    <div><img src="../images/pizzadough.jpg" alt="A fresh pizza" width="400"></div>
    <div>       
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>2 cups all purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
         </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Here's how to do it:</h2>
       <div> 
            <ol>
                <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, olive oil, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in yeast mixture. Stir in remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
                <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Punch dough down, and form a tight ball. Allow the dough to relax for a minute before rolling out. Use for your favorite pizza recipe.</li>
            </ol>
