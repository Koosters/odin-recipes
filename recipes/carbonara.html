    <h2 class="headliner">Ingredients:</h2>
    <div>        
            <ul>
                <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
                <li>4 ounces guanciale (cured pork jowl), pancetta (Italian bacon), or bacon, cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
                <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>1/4 cup reserved pasta water</li>
            <p>And that is everything. Put it all together, real nice, and you've got a carbonara.</p>
        </ul></div>

    <h2 class="headliner">Here's how:</h2>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale (see Cook's Note). Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of the pasta water.</li>
                    <li>Whisk eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, pepper, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Combine spaghetti, guanciale, and egg mixture in a large bowl. Add reserved pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until sauce is creamy and clings to the pasta.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.</li>
                </ol>
